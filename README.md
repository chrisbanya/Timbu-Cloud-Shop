Task
In this stage, you'll step outside your individual coding zone and embrace collaboration! Here's the mission:
Find a Designer: Partner up with a designer. This is your chance to showcase your communication and teamwork skills.
Design Implementation: Collaborate with your designer to bring their Timbu Cloud shop page design to life. Translate the design into a functional webpage using React(.tsx/.jsx) / Nextjs(.tsx/.jsx). Make sure thereâ€™s a checkout page as well.
Requirements
Collaboration: Effective communication and teamwork with your assigned designer throughout the development process. (you are only allowed to collaborate with a designer, any collaboration with your fellow FE dev will result to instant disqualification).
Technologies: Typescript or JavaScript.
Responsiveness: The website must be responsive and function well on all devices (desktop, tablet,mobile).
The shop page should reflect the designer's vision.
Products should be displayed with clear descriptions and images.
A checkout page checkout process should be implemented.
There will be no functional checkout process at this stage.
All static pages must be implemented.
